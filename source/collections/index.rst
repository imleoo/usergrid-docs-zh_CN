Entities & Collections
======================

The basic data operations in Usergrid are centered around the idea of entities
and collections. An entity is a JSON object used by your application. Your app
can define any types of entities it likes and we provide a set of these for
you. Entities are organized into collections. This is roughly analogous to the
idea of a database with rows in a table, but at a much higher-level. We make
it very easy for you to create entities of your own and we provide a set of
pre-built entities for common application tasks. We also make it very easy to
find entities in the system, using built-in search technology to make every
aspect of your data searchable. This is much simpler than using a conventional
database for your app, and makes you immediately more productive.
