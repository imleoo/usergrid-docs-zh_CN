Beta Notes - Read Me First (Updated 10/8/2011 5:18 PM)
======================================================

 - We're erasing the data on the beta servers fairly regular during major code
   updates.

 - Authenticated-access to application data is currently not required during
   the early beta period in order to make testing of the API easier without
   complicating it with authentication issues. Please don't put sensitive data
   into your apps until we turn it back on.

 - There are a lot of pieces of the Console that are still being worked on.
   Not all of these will be in the first open release and will be removed. The
   API is still be preferred mechanism for all object management.
