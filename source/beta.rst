Beta Notes - Read Me First (9/29/2011 10:40 AM)
===============================================

 - We're recommending using the Usergrid Launcher
   (https://usergrid.s3.amazonaws.com/usergrid-launcher-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar),
   to run your own local Usergrid instance during the Beta period. We'll be
   slowly letting people into the beta of the live service but running it
   locally will let you get started right away. We'll also be adding
   additional documentation and tools for running your own installation at
   Amazon and other hosting providers.

 - We're erasing the data on the beta servers fairly regular during major code
   updates.

 - Fine-grain permissions are not yet implemented. This will be added soon but
   in the meantime you should be aware of this and not go into production
   until this is ready.

 - There are a lot of pieces of the Console that are still being worked on.
   Not all of these will be in the first open release and will be removed. The
   API is still be preferred mechanism for all object management.
