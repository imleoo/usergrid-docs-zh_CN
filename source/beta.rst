Beta Notes - Read Me First (1/18/2012 9:00 PM)
===============================================

 - We're recommending using the `Usergrid Launcher 
   <https://usergrid.ci.cloudbees.com/job/Usergrid%20Nightly/lastSuccessfulBuild/org.usergrid$usergrid-launcher/artifact/org.usergrid/usergrid-launcher/0.0.1-SNAPSHOT/usergrid-launcher-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar>`_,
   to run your own local Usergrid instance during the Beta period. We'll be
   slowly letting people into the beta of the live service but running it
   locally will let you get started right away. We'll also be adding
   additional documentation and tools for running your own installation at
   Amazon and other hosting providers.

 - There are a lot of pieces of the Console that are still being worked on.
   Not all of these will be in the first open release and will be removed. The
   API is still be preferred mechanism for all object management.
