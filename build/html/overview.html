<h1>Overview and Key Concepts<a class="headerlink" href="#overview-and-key-concepts" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>This section provides an overview of the key concepts for using Usergrid.</p>
<div class="section" id="admin-and-organization-accounts">
<h2>Admin and Organization Accounts<a class="headerlink" href="#admin-and-organization-accounts" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>When you signup up on the Usergrid.com site, you create an organization
account for your company or team and an individual account for yourself that
has admin rights to that organization. Your individual account can be a member
of multiple organizations.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="administration-console">
<h2>Administration Console<a class="headerlink" href="#administration-console" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Once you create a account through the quick signup process, you&#8217;ll be
presented with the Console. The Console is designed for team usage with a
lightweight delegated administration capability. Different classes of
administrative users will have access to different capabilities. For example,
one common scenario is that you’ll be creating applications for a client who
you will give sign-in access to. That client will only have the ability to see
and potentially modify configuration settings for their application.</p>
<p>One important aspect of the Console that may not be immediately apparent tois
that the entire Console is actually an HTML5/Javascript application that talks
to the service via our public APIs. The Console is also the most complete
reference application for using Usergrid from Javascript and is fully open
source and forkable on GitHub at <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/usergrid/console">https://github.com/usergrid/console</a>. This
lets you easily extend it or embed it into your own applications and to
inspect the code to see the recommend ways for interacting with our API. The
Usergrid Javascript client is part of the Console project.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="applications">
<h2>Applications<a class="headerlink" href="#applications" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Typically, for every app that you build, you&#8217;d create a new Application within
Usergrid, so that your app would have it&#8217;s own private space to store it&#8217;s
objects and data. In some cases, if you had several apps that shared most of
the same data and users, you might represent them in Usergrid as a single
Application and the apps would share the data space.</p>
<div class="section" id="applications-in-the-console">
<h3>Applications In the Console<a class="headerlink" href="#applications-in-the-console" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The Application dashboard shows all of the information for an application. You
can see activity level, total number of objects, objects created in the last
day, week, and month, and other vital statistics for monitoring the health of
your app as well as where you are within your quota limits.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="entities-and-collections">
<h2>Entities And Collections<a class="headerlink" href="#entities-and-collections" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In the Console, you&#8217;ll see the word “entities” in several places. This is the
term that Usergrid uses for how it stores the objects it manages. Usergrid
defines specific entity types and associated logic for these entities.
However, you can also create your own, and, unlike records in conventional
database tables, which have a very rigid schema which defines what can and
can&#8217;t be stored in them and how they can be related to each other, Usergrid
entities are very flexible in what they can store and how they can be
connected. In this way, Usergrid is much better at managing data for modern
applications with “social” features, where people, places, and content are
connected together in whatever way is most appropriate from a user
perspective.</p>
<p>Each entity has at minimum a unique UUID, and a type, which is a string such
as “user”, “group”, or “location”. Your application also has a similar UUID, and
when you access the system via the API, you&#8217;ll always provide the application
UUID and typically the entity UUID of the entity you&#8217;re modifying or
retrieving. Entities may also have one or more unique properties, like a name
property, that can be used as alternate ways to retrieve an entity.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a very simple example of an entity:</p>
<div class="highlight-javascript"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="s2">&quot;uuid&quot;</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;1c18ca40-90b2-11e0-b91b-12313f0204bb&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="s2">&quot;type&quot;</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;user&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="s2">&quot;created&quot;</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="mi">1307415547108000</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="s2">&quot;modified&quot;</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="mi">1307415547108000</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="s2">&quot;username&quot;</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;edanuff&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="s2">&quot;email&quot;</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;ed@anuff.com&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="s2">&quot;name&quot;</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Ed Anuff&quot;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>In terms of what can be stored in properties, we’ve specifically focused on
data that can be stored as JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), which is
supported by almost all languages and can represent most types of data and
content.</p>
<div class="section" id="pre-defined-entity-types">
<h3>Pre-Defined Entity Types<a class="headerlink" href="#pre-defined-entity-types" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>For system-provided entities, Usergrid defines a schema, which specifies which
core properties are defined, what types of values they can contain, whether
they&#8217;re required, as well as indexed or unique. It also defines whether the
entity has collections of other entities. This makes it possible for the
service to make smart decisions about how to manage the data. However,
Usergrid also allows you to assign your own custom dynamic properties, to the
pre-defined entities. These properties can be anything you want, their
contents are always indexed, and in all other ways can be used like the
regular core properties. Further, although not a requirement, we do enable the
uploading of custom schemas into the system.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="collections">
<h3>Collections<a class="headerlink" href="#collections" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<img alt="_images/application_entities.png" src="_images/application_entities.png" />
<p>Entities are stored in collections. For every entity type, there&#8217;s a root
collection that contains all entities of that type. Root collections are
automatically named for the plural form of the entity type. For example, an
entity of type &#8220;user&#8221; are stored in the &#8220;users&#8221; root collection.</p>
<p>Some entities contain collections of other entities. For example, a group will
contain a collection of the users in that group. Entities can be in more than
one collection but are always members of the root collection for their entity
type.</p>
<p>Collections can be searched and iterated through. Most predefined entity
properties are indexed and all application-defined properties are indexed,
allowing you to easily query collections.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="connecting-entities-together">
<h3>Connecting Entities Together<a class="headerlink" href="#connecting-entities-together" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>One of the most powerful things about entities is that they can be connected
together in a completely dynamic fashion. This eliminates much of the typical
challenges of pre-defining relationships in a conventional database. Any two
entities can be connected together with a specific connection type. For
example, to emulate how Twitter does following of users, you&#8217;d connect two
User entities together with a connection type of “follows”. The system
organizes the data for fast queries against connections, so that, for example,
to find all the other users that a user was following, under the hood the
system would be doing a single “database read”. Of course, Usergrid manages
this for you and in most cases you don&#8217;t need to worry about how expensive
these types of operations are, because the system organizes the data for fast
retrieval.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="messages-events-and-activities">
<h2>Messages, Events, and Activities<a class="headerlink" href="#messages-events-and-activities" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Most modern apps struggle to manage streams of data, whether they be content
such as comments, activities, and tweets, or things like event logs for
analytics. Mobile applications in particular are prone to generating very
large amounts of this sort of data. In addition, this data often needs to be
automatically routed to subscribers or filtered or counted.</p>
<p>Usergrid separates this type of data from the regular entities that it
manages. This is because the volume of this data is significantly higher than
that of all the rest of the data that an application manages. For example, at
the time of this writing, it&#8217;s been reported in the press that Twitter has
roughly as many Tweets on a daily basis as it has users since that service
started. In Usergrid, we store activities and events into a highly scalable
message queue system that is designed to keep up with very high rates of data.</p>
<p>The message queue can be used directly, and supports many of the standard
types of operations found in enterprise message queue systems or services like
Amazon&#8217;s SQS. However, we also create two higher-level mechanisms for using
messages. The are Activities and Events.</p>
<p>Activities use the message queue capabilities under the hood to implement
activity streams for your application. These are based on the Activity Streams
specification at <a class="reference external" href="http://activitystrea.ms/">http://activitystrea.ms/</a>. Activity distribution to followers
and group members is automatically handled, so you don&#8217;t need to manually
construct these as publish and subscribe relationships in the message queue.</p>
<p>Events are used for logging purposes in your application, and provide a simple
way to sent data that you want to keep track of for business intelligence or
analytics purposes.</p>
